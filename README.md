# A Next Level Adventure

 Repository for my adventure game "A Next Level Adventure". **Play the game here:** <https://gitrogatog.itch.io/a-next-level-adventure>
 **WARNING:** Reading the code will probably spoil the game experience!!! Please play the game first, it's just 1 hour long and is completely free.
 The code is not necessarily "good" but there aren't many resources on using Moontools ECS online so I figured it would be helpful to someone.
